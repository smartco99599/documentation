========
Time Off
========

Odoo's *Time Off* application is a centralized place where all time off information is housed, from
requests, balances, allocations, approvals, and reports. Users can request time off, managers can
approve time off requests, allocate time off to individuals, teams, or the whole company, reports
can be run to see how much time off and what kinds are being used, accrual plans can be created, and
public holidays can be set.

Be advised, only users with specific access rights can see all aspects of the *Time Off*
application. All users can access the :guilabel:`My Time Off` and :guilabel:`Overview` sections of
the *Time Off* application. All other sections require specific access rights. To better understand
how access rights affect the *Time Off* application, refer to the
:doc:`/applications/hr/employees/new_employee` document, specifically the section about configuring
the work information tab.

Configuration
=============

In order to allocate time off to employees, and for employees to request and use their time off, the
various types of time off must first be configured, then allocated to employees (if allocation is
required).

.. _time_off/time-off-types:

Time off types
--------------

To view the currently configured time off types, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application
--> Configuration --> Time Off Types`. The time off types are presented in a list view. Odoo comes
with four time off types pre-configured in the *Time Off* application: :guilabel:`Paid Time Off`,
:guilabel:`Sick Time Off`, :guilabel:`Unpaid`, and :guilabel:`Compensatory Days`. Any of these may
be modified to suit the needs of the businesses, or can be used as-is.

Create a new time off type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new time off type, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> Configuration
--> Time Off Types`. Click the :guilabel:`Create` button and a new time off type form loads.

Enter the name for the particular type of time off in the blank line at the top of the form, such as
`Sick Time` or `Vacation`. Then, enter the following information on the form:

Time Off Requests section
*************************

- :guilabel:`Approval`: Select what specific kind of approval is required for the time off type.
  Options are:

  - :guilabel:`No Validation`: no approvals are required when requesting this type of time off. The
    time off request is automatically approved when requested.
  - :guilabel:`By Time Off Officer`: only the specified :ref:`Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>`, set on this form, is required to approve the time off request.
  - :guilabel:`By Employee's Approver`: only the employee's specified approver for time off, which
    is set on the work information tab on the :ref:`employee's form <employees/work-info-tab>`, is
    required to approve the time off request.
  - :guilabel:`By Employee's Approver and Time Off Officer`: both the employee's :ref:`specified
    time off approver<employees/work-info-tab>` and the :ref:`Time Off Officer
    <time_off/time-off-officer>` are required to approve the time off request.

.. _time_off/time-off-officer:

- :guilabel:`Responsible Time Off Officer`: select the person responsible for approving requests for
  this specific type of time off requests and allocations.
- :guilabel:`Take Time Off in`: select the format the time off is requested from the drop-down menu.
  Options are :guilabel:`Day`, if time off can only be requested in full day increments (8 hours),
  :guilabel:`Half Day`, if time off can only be requested in half day increments (4 hours), or
  :guilabel:`Hours`, if the time off can be taken in hourly increments.
- :guilabel:`Deduct Extra Hours`: if the time off request should factor in any extra time accrued by
  the employee, enable this box. For example if an employee worked 2 extra hours for the week, and
  requests five (5) hours of time off, the request would be for three (3) hours since the two (2)
  additionally worked hours are used first, and deducted from the request.
- :guilabel:`Allow To Join Supporting Document`: enable this option for the employee to attach
  documents to the time off request. This is useful in situations where documentation is required,
  such as long-term medical leave.
- :guilabel:`Kind of Leave`: select from the drop-down menu the type of leave this time off type is,
  either :guilabel:`Time Off` or :guilabel:`Other`.
- :guilabel:`Company`: if multiple companies are created in the database, and this time off type
  only applies to one company, select the company form the drop-don menu. If this field is left
  blank, the time off type applies to all companies.

Allocation Requests section
***************************

- :guilabel:`Requires allocation`: if the time off must be allocated to employees, select
  :guilabel:`Yes`. If the time off can be requested without time off being previously allocated,
  select :guilabel:`No Limit`. if :guilabel:`No Limit` is selected, the followings options do not
  appear on the form.
- :guilabel:`Employee Requests`: select :guilabel:`Extra Days Requests Allowed` if the employee is
  able to request more time off than was allocated. For example, if ten (10) days are allocated to
  the employee for this particular type of time off, and this option is enabled, the employee may
  submit a request for more than ten (10) days.  If employees should not make requests for more time
  off than what was allocated, select the :guilabel:`Not Allowed` option.
- :guilabel:`Approval`: select the type of approval(s) required for the allocation of this
  particular type of time off. :guilabel:`No validation needed` indicates that no approvals are
  required. :guilabel:`Approved by Time Off Officer` indicates the :ref:`Time Off Officer
  <time_off/time-off-officer>` set on this form must approve the allocation. :guilabel:`Set by Time
  Off Officer` indicates that the :ref:`Time Off Officer <time_off/time-off-officer>` set on this
  form must allocate the time off.

Payroll section
***************

- :guilabel:`Work Entry Type`: if this time off type should create
  :doc:`/applications/hr/payroll/work_entries` in the *Payroll* application, select the type of work
  entry created from the drop-down list.

Display Options section
***********************

- :guilabel:`Color`: select a color to be used in the *Time Off* application dashboard.
- :guilabel:`Cover Image`: select an icon to be used in the *Time Off* application dashboard.

.. note::
   The only required fields on the time off type form is the name of the :guilabel:`Time Off Type`,
   and the :guilabel:`Responsible Time Off Officer`.

.. image:: time_off/time-off-type-form.png

   :alt: Time off type form with all the information filled out for sick time off.

Accrual plans
-------------

Some time off is earned through an accrual plan, meaning that for every specified amount of time an
employee works (hour, day, week, etc), they *earn* or accrue a specified amount of time off.

.. example::
   If an employee accrues a vacation day for every week they work, they would *earn* or accrue 0.2
   vacation days for each hour they work. At the end of a forty (40) hour work week, they earn a
   whole vacation day (8 hours).

Create a new accrual plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new accrual plan, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> Configuration
--> Accrual Plans`. Click the :guilabel:`Create` button and a new accrual plan form loads.

Enter the accrual plan name in the :guilabel:`Name` field. If the accrual plan only applies to a
specific time off type, select it from the drop-down menu. If this accrual plan is available for all
time off types, leave this field blank.

Rules
*****

Rules must be created in order for the accrual plan to accrue time off. To create a new rule, click
the :guilabel:`Add A New Level` button right beneath the word `Rules`, and a create level form
appears. Fill out the following fields on the form:

- :guilabel:`Start after (X) (time) after allocation date`: enter the number and value of the time
  period that must pass before the employee starts to accumulate time off. The first value is
  numerical; enter a number in the first field. Select the type of time using the drop-down menu in
  the second field. The options are :guilabel:`day(s)`, :guilabel:`month(s)`, or
  :guilabel:`year(s)`.
- :guilabel:`Based on worked time`: enable this option if the accrual of time off is based on the
  time the employee has worked. If an employee takes time off that is not considered a worked day,
  Odoo will not count that day towards their accrual plan.
- :guilabel:`Rate (X) (time)`: enter the rate of time off that is accumulated. The first value is
  numerical; enter a number in the first field. Whole numbers are not necessary, any decimal value
  may be entered. Next, in the second field, select the type of time accrued using the drop-down
  menu. The options are either :guilabel:`Days` or :guilabel:`Hours`.
- :guilabel:`Frequency (X)`: select how often the employee accrues the time off for this rule using
  the drop-down menu. Options are :guilabel:`Daily`, :guilabel:`Weekly`, :guilabel:`Twice a month`,
  :guilabel:`Monthly`, :guilabel:`Twice a year`, or :guilabel:`Yearly.` Depending on the selection,
  more fields appear to specify exactly when the accrual renews.

.. example::
   If the employee should accrue one vacation day for every week worked, the :guilabel:`Rate` is set
   to `1`, and the :guilabel:`Frequency` entry is set to `Frequency (Weekly) on (Friday)`. Only the
   :guilabel:`Frequency` and :guilabel:`Weekday` fields appear.

   If the employee should accrue ten vacation days each year, and they receive these days every year
   on the first of January, the :guilabel:`Rate` is set to `10`, and the :guilabel:`Frequency` entry
   is set to `Frequency (Yearly) on the (1) of (January)`. The :guilabel:`Frequency`,
   :guilabel:`Date`, and :guilabel:`Month` fields appear.

- :guilabel:`Limit to`: enter a maximum amount of days the employee can accrue with this plan.
- :guilabel:`At the end of the calendar year, unused accruals will be`: select from the drop-down
  menu how unused time off is handled. Options are either :guilabel:`Transferred to the next year`,
  which rolls over unused time to the next calendar year, or :guilabel:`Lost`, which means any
  unused time off is gone.

When the form is filled out, click :guilabel:`Save & Close` to save the form and close the pop-up,
or :guilabel:`Save & New` to save the form and create a new rule. Add as many levels as desired.

Public holidays
---------------

Most countries have public or national holidays, and some companies may have specific days they
are closed and give extra days as holidays. It is important to configure these days in Odoo, so that
employees are aware of the days they have off, and do not request time off on days that are already
set as a public holiday (non working days).

Create a new public holiday
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a public holiday, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> Configuration
--> Public Holidays`. All currently configured public holidays appear in a list view. Click the
:guilabel:`Create` button and a new line appears at the bottom of the list. Enter the following
information:

- :guilabel:`Name`: enter the name of the holiday.
- :guilabel:`Company`: if in a multi-company database, the current company populates this field by
  default. It is not possible to edit this field.
- :guilabel:`Start Date`: using the date and time picker, select the date and time that the holiday
  starts. By default, this field is configured for the current date, with a time of 8:00:00 (8 AM).
- :guilabel:`End Date`: using the date and time picker, select the date and time that the holiday
  ends. By default, this field is configured for the current date, with a time of 17:00:00 (5 PM).
- :guilabel:`Working Hours`: if the holiday should only apply to employees who have a specific set
  of working hours, select the working hours form the drop-down menu. If left blank, the holiday
  applies to all employees.
- :guilabel:`Work Entry Type`: if using the *Payroll* application, this field defines how the work
  entry for the holiday appears. Select the work entry type from the drop-down menu.

.. image:: time_off/holidays.png

Allocate time off
=================

Once time off types and accrual plans have been configured, the next step is to allocate, or give,
time off to employees. This section is only visible to users who have either :guilabel:`Time Off
Officer` or :guilabel:`Administrator` access rights for the *Time Off* application.

To create a new allocation, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> Approvals -->
Allocations`. This presents a list of all current allocations, including their respective status.
Click :guilabel:`Create` to allocate time off, and an allocation form loads. Enter the following
information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Name for Allocation`: enter a name for the allocation. This should be short and
  descriptive, such as `Annual Time Off 2024`.
- :guilabel:`Time Off Type`: using the drop-down menu, select the type of time off that is being
  allocated to the employees.
- :guilabel:`Allocation Type`: select either :guilabel:`Regular Allocation` or :guilabel:`Accrual

  select the accrual plan the allocation is associated with. An accrual plan **must** be selected
  for an :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation`.
- :guilabel:`Validity Period/Start Date`: if :guilabel:`Regular Allocation` is selected for the
  :guilabel:`Allocation Type`, this field is labeled :guilabel:`Validity Period`. Using the
  calendar, picker, select the beginning date for the allocation. If the allocation expires, select
  the expiration date in the next date field. If the time off does not expire, leave the second date
  field blank. If :guilabel:`Accrual Allocation` is selected for the :guilabel:`Allocation Type`,
  this field is labeled :guilabel:`Start Date`. Using the calendar picker, select the start date for
  the allocation. If the allocation expires, select the expiration date in the :guilabel:`Run until`
  field. If the time off does not expire, leave the :guilabel:`Run until` field blank.
- :guilabel:`Duration`: enter the amount of time that is being allocated to the employees. This
  field will display the time in either :guilabel:`Hours` or :guilabel:`Days`, depending on how the
  selected the :ref:`Time Off Type <time_off/time-off-types>` is configured (in days or hours).
- :guilabel:`Mode`: using the drop-down menu, select how the allocation is assigned. This selection

  tags who are receiving this time off. Multiple selections can be made for either
  :guilabel:`Employees` or :guilabel:`Employee Tag`. Only one selection can be made for the
  :guilabel:`Company` or :guilabel:`Department`.
- :guilabel:`Add a reason...`: if any description or note is necessary to explain the time off
  allocation, enter it in this field at the bottom of the form.

.. _time_off/request-time-off:

Request time off
================

Once an employee has been allocated time off, a request to use the time off can be submitted. Time
off can be requested in one of two ways, either from the :ref:`dashboard <time_off/dashboard>` or
the :guilabel:`My Time Off` view.

To access the dashboard, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> My Time Off -->
Dashboard`. This is also the default view for the *Time Off* application. To access :guilabel:`My
Time Off`, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> My Time Off --> My Time Off`. This
presents a list view of all the time off requests for the employee.

To create a new request for time off, click either the :guilabel:`New Time Off` button on the main
*Time Off* dashboard, or the :guilabel:`Create` button in the :guilabel:`My Time Off` list view.
Both buttons open a new time off request form. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Time Off Type`: select the type of time off being requested from the drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Dates`: enter the dates that the time off will fall under. There are two fields to
  populate, the :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`To` fields. Click on either the :guilabel:`From` or
  :guilabel:`To` field, and a calendar pop-up appears. Click on the start date, then click on the
  end date. The selected start and end dates appear in deep purple, and the dates between them
  appear in pale purple (if applicable). If the time off requested is for a single day, click on the
  start date, then click the same date again for the end date. When the correct dates are
  selected/highlighted, click the :guilabel:`Apply` button. The dates now populate the
  :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`To` fields.

  - :guilabel:`Half Day`: if the time off request is for a half day, activate this box. When this is
    selected, the :guilabel:`From` date field disappears, and is replaced with a drop-down menu.
    Select either :guilabel:`Morning` or :guilabel:`Afternoon` to indicate which half of the day is
    requested.
  - :guilabel:`Custom Hours`: if the time off requested is not a whole or half day, activate this
    box. A :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`To` field appears beneath this option if selected. Using
    the drop-down menu, select the start and end time for the time off request.

- :guilabel:`Duration`: this field updates automatically once the :guilabel:`Date` section is
  completed. If the :guilabel:`Date` section is modified, this section automatically updates to
  reflect toe total time off requested. This field is in either hours or days, depending on the
  :guilabel:`Date` selections.
- :guilabel:`Description`: enter a description for the time off request. This should include any
  details that the manager and approvers need in order to approve the request.
- :guilabel:`Supporting Document`: if the :guilabel:`Time Off Type` selected allows for the
  attachments of documents, this field appears. Click the :guilabel:`Attach File` button and a file
  explorer window appears. Navigate to the file(s) to attach, then click the :guilabel:`Open`
  button. The files then appear on the time off request form. Multiple documents can be attached.

When the form is complete, click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the information and submit the
request.

.. _time_off/request-allocation:

Request allocation
==================

If an employee has used all their time off, or is going to run out of time off, they can request
an allocation for additional time. Allocations can be requested in one of two ways, either from the
:ref:`dashboard <time_off/dashboard>` or the :guilabel:`My Allocations` view.

To access the dashboard, navigate to the :menuselection:`Time Off application --> My Time Off -->
Dashboard`. This is also the default view for the *Time Off* application.

To access :guilabel:`My Allocations`, navigate to the :menuselection:`Time Off application --> My
Time Off --> My Allocations`. This presents a list view of all the allocations for the employee.

To create a new allocation request, click either the :guilabel:`Allocation Request` button on the
main *Time Off* dashboard, or the :guilabel:`Create` button in the :guilabel:`My Allocations` list
view. Both buttons open a new allocation request form. Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Allocation Name`: enter a name for the allocation. This should be descriptive such as
  `Additional Sick Time 2024`.
- :guilabel:`Time Off Type`: select the type of time off being requested for the allocation from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Validity Period`: the current date populates the start date by default. If there is no
  expiration on the time off type, there will be no date populated as the end date. If the time off
  type has an expiration date, the date will automatically populate the end date field once the form
  is saved.
- :guilabel:`Duration`: enter the amount of time being requested. The format (either days or hours)
  is in the same format as the time off type.
- :guilabel:`Add a reason...`: enter a description for the allocation request. This should include
  any details that the manager and approvers need in order to approve the request.

When the form is complete, click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the information and submit the
request.

         sick time.

Approvals
=========

Most requests for both time off and allocations need to go through the approval process prior to the
time off being allocated and then granted to an employee. Requests either need one or two approvals,
depending on how the specific type of time off type is configured.

Keep in mind, only users who can approve allocation and time of requests will have the
:guilabel:`Approvals` section visible in the *Time Off* application.

Approve allocations
-------------------

To view allocations that need approval, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application -->
Approvals --> Allocations`. The only allocations visible on this list are for employees the user
has either :guilabel:`Time Off Officer` or :guilabel:`Administrator` access rights for the *Time
Off* application.

The default filters that are configured to be in place when navigating to the
:guilabel:`Allocations` list are :guilabel:`My Team` and :guilabel:`Active Employee`. This presents
only employees on the users team (who they manage) and active employees. Employees who no longer
work for the business are not shown.

The left side of the screen has various grouping options to quickly narrow down the presented
allocation requests. To display allocations that need to be approved, click :guilabel:`To Approve`.
To view the various other statuses, click on the other statuses to view only those requests. The
options are :guilabel:`To Approve`, :guilabel:`To Submit`, :guilabel:`Refused`, and
:guilabel:`Approved`. To view all allocation requests, click :guilabel:`All`. It is also possible to
display allocation requests by department. Click on the department to present only allocations for
that specific department.

.. note::
   Keep in mind, the groupings on the left side will only present allocation requests that fall
   under the default filters of :guilabel:`My Team` and :guilabel:`Active Employee`. Only the
   statuses for allocation requests that fall under those filters are presented on the left side.
   For example if there are no requests with a status of :guilabel:`To Submit`, that status option
   does not appear in the left hand side.

   On the contrary, all departments for the user's employees appear in the list. If there are no
   allocation requests that fall under that department matching the pre-configured filters, then the
   list is blank. It is always possible to remove any of the pre-configured filters. Click the X on
   the specific filter to remove it.

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status highlighted in a specific
color. The :guilabel:`To Approve` requests are highlighted in yellow, :guilabel:`Approved` requests
are highlighted in green, :guilabel:`To Submit` (drafts) requests are highlighted in blue, and the
:guilabel:`Refused` requests are highlighted in gray.

To approve an allocation request, click :guilabel:`✔ Validate` at the end of the line, to refuse a
request, click :guilabel:`X Refuse`.

.. image:: time_off/allocations.png

   :alt: Allocations with the filter, groupings, and status sections highlighted.

If more details are needed, click anywhere on the allocation request line (except for
:guilabel:`✔ Validate` and :guilabel:`X Refuse`) to view the request in detail. The allocation
request form loads. Depending on the rights of the user, changes can be made. To modify the request,
click the :guilabel:`Edit` button, make any desired changes, then click :guilabel:`Save`. It is also
possible to approve or refuse the request from this form. Click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to
approve, or the :guilabel:`Refuse` button to refuse the request.

Approve time off
----------------

To view time off requests that need approval, navigate to :menuselection:`Time Off application -->
Approvals --> Time Off`. The only time off requests visible on this list are for employees the user
has either :guilabel:`Time Off Officer` or :guilabel:`Administrator` access rights for the *Time
Off* application.

The default filters that are configured to be in place when navigating to the :guilabel:`Time Off`
list are :guilabel:`To Approve`, :guilabel:`My Team`, :guilabel:`Active Employee`, and
:guilabel:`Active Time Off`. This presents only time off requests that need to be approved for
current employees on the users team, for requests that are active and not in a draft mode.

The left side of the screen has various grouping options to quickly narrow down the presented
time off requests. Since only time off requests that need to be approved are shown, the only status
options are :guilabel:`All` and :guilabel:`To Approve`. To view requests with other statuses, first
remove the :guilabel:`To Approve` filter. Click the X on the :guilabel:`To Approve` filter to remove
it.

To display time off requests for specific departments, click on the department on the left hand
side. Only requests within the selected department will be presented.

The status column displays the status of each request, with the status highlighted in a specific
color. The :guilabel:`To Approve` requests are highlighted in yellow, and are the only ones that
appear in the list by default. If the :guilabel:`To Approve` filter is removed, then all statuses
appear. :guilabel:`Approved` requests are highlighted in green, :guilabel:`To Submit` (drafts)
requests are highlighted in blue, and the :guilabel:`Refused` requests are highlighted in gray.

To approve a time off request, click :guilabel:`👍 Approve` at the end of the line, to refuse a
request, click :guilabel:`X Refuse`.

If more details are needed, click anywhere on the time off request line (except for :guilabel:`👍
Approve` and :guilabel:`X Refuse`) to view the request in detail. The time off request form loads.
Depending on the rights of the user, changes can be made. To modify the request, click the
:guilabel:`Edit` button, make any desired changes, then click :guilabel:`Save`. It is also possible
to approve or refuse the request from this form. Click the :guilabel:`Approve` button to approve, or
the :guilabel:`Refuse` button to refuse the request.

My time off
===========

The :guilabel:`My Time Off` section of the *Time Off* application contains the time off dashboard,
as well as the users time off requests and allocations.

.. _time_off/dashboard:

Dashboard
---------

All users have access to the time off dashboard, which is the default view in the *Time Off*
application. The dashboard can also be accessed at any point in the application by navigating to
:menuselection:`Time Off application --> My Time Off --> Dashboard`.

The current year is displayed, with all twelve months visible on the dashboard. The current day is
highlghted in red. To change the view, click on the desired button at the top. Options are
:guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`, :guilabel:`Month`, or :guilabel:`Year` (the default). To change
the presented dates, click the left and right arrows on either side of the :guilabel:`Today` button.
The calendar view adjusts in increments of the presented view. For example, if :guilabel:`Week` is
selected, the arrows adjust the view by one week. To change the view at any point to a view that
includes the current date, click the :guilabel:`Today` button.

Above the calendar view is a summary of the users time off balances. Every time off type that has
been allocated appears in its own summary box. Each summary lists the type of time off, the
corresponding icon, the current available balance (in hours or days), and an expiration date (if
applicable). To view more details on the specific time off, click the :guilabel:`? (question mark)`
after the  line `Hours (or Days) Available`. A pop up appears listing the total time allocated, the
approved time off, the planned time off, and the total ending balance with those numbers factored
in. The time off balance labeled as :guilabel:`Left` is what is displayed next to the icon in the
summary. Click the :guilabel:`? (question mark)` again to close the pop-up.

The legend on the right side of the calendar view displays the various time off types, with their
corresponding colors. The status of the time off requests are shown as well. Time off that has been
validated appears in a solid color (in the color specified in the Time Off Types part of the
legend). Time off requests that still needs to be approved appear with white stripes in the color.
Refused time off requests have a colored line through the dates.

New time off requests can be made from the dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`New Time Off` button at
the top of the dashboard, and a new :ref:`time off form <time_off/request-time-off>` appears. New

Overview

To view a color-coded schedule of both the user' time off, and/or the team managed by them, navigate
to :menuselection:`Time Off application --> Overview`. This presents a calendar with the default
filter of :guilabel:`My Team`, in a month view. To change the time period displayed, click on either
the :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`, or :guilabel:`Year` buttons to present the calendar in that
corresponding view.

Each team member is displayed on a line, and any time off they requested, regardless of the status
(:guilabel:`Validated` or :guilabel:`To Approve`), appears on the calendar. Each employee is
color-coded. The employee's color is selected at random, and do not correspond ot the type of time
off they requested. The status of the time of is represented by the color of the request either
appearing solid (:guilabel:`Validated`) or striped (:guilabel:`To Approve`). The number of days or
hours requested is written on the request (if there is enough space). At the bottom of the calendar,
a bar graph shows how may people are projected ot be out on any given day. The number on the bar
represents the number of employees out for those highlighted days.

Hover over a time off entry to view the details for the specific time off entry. The total number of
hours or days are listed, along with the start and end time of the time off.
